The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

*These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern: *

'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

*The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: *

mean(): Mean value,

std(): Standard deviation,

mad(): Median absolute deviation ,

max(): Largest value in array,

min(): Smallest value in array,

sma(): Signal magnitude area,

energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values,

iqr(): Interquartile range,

entropy(): Signal entropy,

arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4,

correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals,

maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude,

meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency,

skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal,

kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal,

bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window,

angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean,

tBodyAccMean,

tBodyAccJerkMean,

tBodyGyroMean,

tBodyGyroJerkMean

*Out of the entire dataset, only the mean and the standard deviation values for each subject and activity were extracted. * *From this dataset, a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject was created. *
